## About The Project

<img src="https://github.com/bfgonzalez/portfolio/blob/master/public/static/thumbnail.png">

The last time my [portfolio](https://bfgonzalez.github.io/) had any significant updates was in 2018 (this project was started halfway through 2019). Even if it wasn't too long ago, my portfolio was built with the classic HTML + CSS + JS combo (I even used JQuery when I didn't need that much JavaScript to begin with :woman_facepalming:)

I've learned lot more since then, and I figured that redesigning and rebuilding my portfolio from scratch would be the best opportunity for me to apply most of the things I learned up until this point.

### Built With

- [Gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/)
- [React Hooks](https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-intro.html)
- [Bulma](https://bulma.io/)
- [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/)

## Getting Started

Here's how you can run this project on your local machine (although the live demo is available [here](https://bfgonzalez.netlify.app/))

### Prerequisites

- Make sure you have your preferred package manager installed (either [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) or [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/))
- This project was built using [Gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/), so make sure you have `Gatsby CLI` installed

```sh
$ npm install -g gatsby-cli

or

$ yarn add gatsby-cli
```

### Installation

1. Open your terminal and clone the repository

```sh
$ git clone https://github.com/bfgonzalez/portfolio.git
```

2. Switch to the directory where you saved the project

```sh
// example

$ cd ~/Desktop/portfolio
```

3. Once you're in the project directory, install all dependencies

```sh
$ npm install

or

$ yarn install
```

4. After all dependencies have been installed, run the following command

```sh
$ gatsby develop
```

5. If successful, you should get a message stating that you can now view the project on your localhost (`localhost:8000 by default)
